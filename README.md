# Color_detection

## Introduction

#### For this project I wanted to implement Computer vision. I did go through a lot of different ideas.
#### I wanted something that would make it easy to detect what colors are in a photograph (I recently have gotten into photography, so wanted something along those lines). The RGB and the human readable color so that I can paint it, or if I'm just curious so that I may talk about it.
#### First I thought about a machine learning model that would tell me the top 10 colors used in an image. This seemed challenging but fun
#### I then thought about an algorithm that would draw out a certain color of your choice. So choose blue, then everything that's "blue" in that picture would be highlighted. 
#### Example can be found here: https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2014/08/04/opencv-python-color-detection/
#### In the end though, after some attemps at both models and algorithms, I figured a simple point and click would be the best option and by far the most efficient for what i'm going for.

##### The reason this is the best method is this method can make the user decide how many colors are relevant to their needs. Rather of the machine learning algorithm deciding 10 or X number of colors are relevant, just let the user decide. This can stop having too much information if the user just wants one or a few colors detected.
